An Examination of Liquidity Through Bid-Ask Spreads With the Use of Deep Learning

Dissertation submitted as part of the MSc Financial Technology programme at UCL.

# Abstract

The work in this dissertation leverages deep learning, due to its predictive capabilities in financial research, to predict bid-ask spreads with the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Traditional assumptions about the correlation of bid-ask spreads and market liquidity are usually made when such predictive models are designed. A wide bid-ask spread typically indicates low liquidity and a narrow bid-ask spread indicates high liquidity, however, empirical evidence has shown where this does not hold true, specifically when there is less market participation or order imbalances.
Using the LSTM for predictive purposes showed its capability of capturing complex data patterns and high dimensionality of NBBO data. The results showed the need for predictive models that use deep learning as they can capture nuances in the data and are able to pick up many more details than mathematical and statistical approaches are capable of.
This dissertation adds to the scarce literature existing on bid-ask spread prediction using deep learning whilst challenging the bid-ask spread and liquidity relationship with a more data centric approach. These insights have the potential to be extremely useful for market participants in order execution and trading strategies.
